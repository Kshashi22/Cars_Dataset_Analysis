# Cars_Dataset_Analysis

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a **Cars Dataset** obtained from [Kaggle]  to explore trends, patterns, and insights in the automobile industry.
The goal is to perform **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization** to better understand how different features of cars (such as price, horsepower, fuel type, engine size, etc.) affect their performance and market value.

All analytics, visualizations, and insights were created **by me using Google Colab** for a smooth and collaborative data analysis workflow.

## Dataset Details

* **Source:** [Kaggle Cars Dataset]
* **Type:** CSV file
* **Rows:** Varies depending on dataset version
* **Columns:** Features such as:

  * Car Make & Model
  * Price
  * Year of Manufacture
  * Horsepower
  * Engine Size
  * Fuel Type
  * Mileage
  * Transmission Type
  * Number of Doors
  * Country of Origin

##  Tools & Libraries Used

* **Platform:** Google Colab
* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:**

  * `pandas` → Data cleaning & manipulation
  * `numpy` → Numerical operations
  * `matplotlib` & `seaborn` → Data visualization
  * `plotly` → Interactive graphs

##  Project Workflow

1. **Import Dataset** → Load the CSV file from Kaggle into Google Colab.
2. **Data Cleaning** → Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** →

   * Summary statistics
   * Correlation analysis
   * Distribution of features
4. **Data Visualization** →

   * Bar charts, histograms, and box plots
   * Scatter plots for price vs. other features
   * Heatmaps for correlation
5. **Key Insights** → Identify factors influencing car prices and preferences.


## Key Insights from Analysis

* **Price Trends:** Cars with higher horsepower generally cost more.
* **Fuel Type Impact:** Petrol and diesel cars have distinct pricing trends.
* **Brand Influence:** Certain brands maintain higher resale values.
* **Year Factor:** Newer cars tend to have better features but depreciate faster.

##  How to Use This Project

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Google Colab or locally.
3. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.
